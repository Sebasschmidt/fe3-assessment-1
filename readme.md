 ##### Background
This is the first assestment for the front end 3 course. Goal was to represent given data into an visualisation and explaining the code with comments.

 ##### About the chart
The chart visualizes the monthly temprature of De Bilt in the Netherlands.
The chart itself is one from https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955 made by Mike Bostok. I have chosen this chart because it already represented likewise data. The original chart displayed data from three cities.

 ##### Changes
The changes I made to the document where:
* seperating files; index.css, style.css, index.js
* maked changes to variables in the index.js file
* var cities to temp because there is 1 chart displaying the temprature
* var city to chart because there is 1 chart in this case and not 3 as in original chart
* changing the style of the chart
* changing the original tsv link to a csv link
